- [Calling] ------
The Servo.write(int) function is non-blocking and does
NOT require to be called continiously until completion



- [Rotation] -----
SERVO MODE:
  -1  =   0°    ( 500 μs)
   0  =  90°    (1500 μs)
   1  = 180°    (2500 μs)

CONTINIOUS MODE:
  0.0 =   0°    ( 500 μs)
  0.5 =  90°    (1500 μs)
  1.0 = 180°    (2500 μs)

  NB! only rvalues <200 are treated as angles (deg°) 
      in the Servo.write(int) function. Anything >=200 
      is treated as μs!
